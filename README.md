# Learning C Programming

Welcome to my C programming journey! ðŸš€

I am currently learning C programming and exploring its fundamental concepts. This repository contains my practice questions, solutions, and notes as I progress through this learning journey. Feel free to explore, learn, and provide suggestions!

## Practice Questions
Here are some of the areas I'm focusing on:

- **Basic Syntax:** Writing simple programs, understanding input/output, and basic operations.
- **Logical Operators:** Practicing logical AND, OR, NOT operations to build logic in programs.
- **Functions:** Creating and debugging functions to solve problems efficiently.
- **Arrays:** Learning to store and manipulate collections of data.
- **Loops and Conditions:** Working with `for`, `while`, `if-else`, and more.
